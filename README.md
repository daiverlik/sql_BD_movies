#BD movies

A database of movies created on PostgreSQL. The database has two implementations, one by Task, the other with a deviation from the task. Diagrams have been created for the visual representation of BD.

#The diagrams are created for a better visual representation
#Some tables specifically do not have partitioning into additional entities
